# ROT13-Encode-Decode
This is a simple Python script to encode and decode text using the ROT13 method.

This script is very simple. Once the script is run, choose [b]E[/b] for encode, or [b]D[/b] for decode. After doing so, just enter in the string you wish to pass through the function and get the result out.
